# Validation, Feature Selection & Hyperparameter Optimization ðŸ§ 

This project focuses on:
- Cross-validation schemes implementation and comparison
- Feature selection methods (Lasso, Correlation, Permutation, SHAP)
- Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Random Search, Optuna)

## Structure
- `notebooks/03-validation-feature-selection/` â€” step-by-step notebooks
- `src/validation_feature_selection/` â€” modular reusable code
- `data/` â€” raw data
- `models/` â€” saved best models

## Goal
To develop a deep understanding of model validation, feature importance, and optimization strategies for more stable and generalizable ML models.
